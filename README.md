# ryzenadj-service

a service to automatically run a autostart.bat file for https://github.com/FlyGoat/RyzenAdj/releases

this is to avoid the annoying reset issue where the stapm limits would just reset back to OEM defaults.
it runs the file every minute, and at only uses 3MB ram and 0.5% cpu when active. 

i have included examples and other needed files in releases

here is the page for the launcher:
